# PlaylistLoaderLite
This plugin uses the official Playlist loader to load custom playlist files in Beat Saber.
This mod isn't a replacement for PlaylistCore and does not load songs that aren't locally available. Instead, it is for people who prefer a more lightweight mod for loading playlists in the game's native playlist UI.

## ATTENTION INDEX USERS
For scrolling through the playlists in the UI, you need to fix controller bindings to scroll as it requires the thumbstick. Look at this tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4YKwmYvWk&feature=youtu.be) (Credits: Toni Macaroni)

## Features
- Support for JSON & .bplist custom playlists
- Loads custom playlists in the official playlists UI
- Allows refreshing playlists using the "Refresh Playlists" button in the Mods tab

## How To Use
- Create a folder called "Playlists" in your Beat Saber installation folder
- Store your playlists in the playlists folder
